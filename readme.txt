== Description ==
Converts post types from one to another. This plugin is a complete reworking of my old plugin p2pConverter. pTypeConverter allows you to easily convert any post type of a certain post to another in an easy to use interface.  A pTypeConverter role capability prevents unwanted users from converting pages (i.e. only Administrators and Editors have this ability to begin with), which can be adjusted by using a Role Manager plugin.

== Installation ==
Copy the `pTypeConverter` directory to your plugins directory and activate the pTypeConverter
plugin from WordPress. To access pTypeConverter, look under the Tools menu for the pTypeConverter
submenu.
